# Introduction-to-Robotics 2023-2024
*Repo home to the homework/projects assigned as part of the IR course taken in the final year at FMI, UB. Each homework should specify the corresponding tasks, implementation, code and image files that went into the process of solving it.*

## Homework 3
Task summary: "Use the joystick to control the position of the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments should be natural, meaning they should jump from the current positiononly to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”. The initial position should be on the DP. The current position always blinks (irrespective of the fact that the segment is on or off). Use the joystick to move from one position to neighbors (see table for corresponding movement). Short pressing the button toggles the segment state from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. Long pressing the button resets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving the current position to the decimal point."

## Homework 2
Task summary: "Design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino platform. LED Indicators: Each of the 3 LEDs should represent one of the 3 floors. The LED corresponding to the current floor should light up.  Additionally, another LED should represent the elevator’s operational state.  It should blink when the elevator is moving and remain static when stationary. Implement 3 buttons that represent the call buttons from the 3 floors. When pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towardsthe floor after a short interval (2-3 seconds)."

## Homework 1
Task summary: "Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then  write a mapped value to the LED pins."

# Introduction-to-Robotics 2023-2024
*Repo home to the homework/projects assigned as part of the IR course taken in the final year at FMI, UB. Each homework should specify the corresponding tasks, implementation, code and image files that went into the process of solving it.*

## Homework 1
Task: "Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics. Specifically, you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins."

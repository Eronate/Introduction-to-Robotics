# Introduction-to-Robotics 2023-2024
*Repo home to the homework/projects assigned as part of the IR course taken in the final year at FMI, UB. Each homework should specify the corresponding tasks, implementation, code and image files that went into the process of solving it.*

## Homework 1
Task summary: "Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then  write a mapped value to the LED pins."

## Homework 2
Task summary: "Design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino platform. LED Indicators: Each of the 3 LEDs should represent one of the 3 floors. The LED corresponding to the current floor should light up.  Additionally, another LED should represent the elevator’s operational state.  It should blink when the elevator is moving and remain static when stationary. Implement 3 buttons that represent the call buttons from the 3 floors. When pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towardsthe floor after a short interval (2-3 seconds)."
